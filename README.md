## 🎯 What is this?

**Professional-grade monitoring and control** for JK-BMS battery management systems via RS485 or CAN bus.

This add-on transforms your Home Assistant into a complete BMS control center - no expensive proprietary software needed.

### Supported BMS Models
- PB2A16S20P / PB2A16S15P
- PB1A16S15P / PB1A16S10P  
- All models with FW:19

---

## ⚡ Key Features (v3.0.0)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎛️ **Full Configuration UI** | Change BMS settings directly from Home Assistant |
| 🔌 **Multiple Connectivity** | RS485 USB, RS485 Ethernet/WiFi Gateway, CAN Bus |
| 📊 **Multi-BMS Support** | Manage up to 15 BMS units simultaneously |
| 🏠 **Native HA Integration** | Control panel integrated into Home Assistant |
| 📡 **MQTT Compatible** | Works with any MQTT-compatible system |
| 🚨 **21 Alarm Types** | Comprehensive alarm management system |

---

## 🚀 Three Operating Modes

### 1️⃣ Master Mode
The add-on queries each BMS (addresses 1-15) via RS485 to retrieve all data.  
**Full control** - modify parameters directly from the software.

```yaml
bms_broadcasting: false
```

### 2️⃣ Listening Mode  
One BMS acts as the RS485 master (DIP switches: 0000).  
**Read-only mode** - ideal when your inverter requires one BMS to be the bus master.

```yaml
bms_broadcasting: true
```

### 3️⃣ CAN Bus Mode *(New! July 2025)*
Direct CAN bus broadcasting via the second RJ45 connector.  
**Loop broadcasting** - autonomous operation.

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `path` | USB port path | `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0` |
| `nb_jkbms` | Number of BMS units | `1` to `15` |
| `use_gateway` | Using IP gateway? | `true` / `false` |
| `gateway_ip` | Gateway IP address | `192.168.1.100` |
| `gateway_port` | Gateway port | `502` |
| `bms_broadcasting` | Master BMS mode (0000)? | `true` / `false` |
| `mqttaddress` | MQTT broker address | `192.168.1.50` |
| `mqttport` | MQTT broker port | `1883` |
| `mqttuser` | MQTT username | `homeassistant` |
